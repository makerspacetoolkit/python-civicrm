:synopis:Python module to access the CiviCRM v3 API.

Python CiviCRM
==============

This is a module for interacting with the CiviCRM REST API Version 3.

It's use should be fairly straight forward, at least if you have basic
familiarity with the API documentation.

Everything is implemented in the CiviCRM class. You need, at a minimum to pass
a URL, and the your site and API keys when instantiating your object.

This class has methods that correspond to nearly all the underlying actions
provided by the REST API, as well as implementing a few more of its own.
Some of these are more convenient and/or simpler versions of the actions.
Others provide for more complex or specific tasks e.g. adding a contact.
The eventual aim is to match the functionality provided in the PHP API.

There are some differences in how things are implemented, in particular with
how things are returned. See :ref:`things-to-note`.

A CivicrmError will be raised for anything other than a 200 respose e.g. a 404.

Usage
-----
Usage example for a basic search::

    url = 'www.example.org/path/to/civi/codebase/civicrm/extern/rest.php'
    site_key ='your site key'
    api_key ='your api key'
    civicrm = CiviCRM(url, site_key, api_key)

    search_results = civicrm.get('Contact', city='Gotham City')
    first_10_search_results = civicrm.get('Contact',
            city='Gotham City', limit=10)

It can be easier to construct a dict and feed them to methods using ** to
expand it to key value pairs::

    my_dict =   {
                country      = 'United States',
                city         ='Gotham City',
                contact_type ='Individual
                }
    civicrm.get('Contact', **my_dict)

The following optional values can be supplied when intializing:
    use_ssl=True/False      Connect over https not http, defaults to True.
    timeout=N               Connection will time out in N seconds, i.e if
                            no response is sent by the server in N seconds.
                            requests.exceptions.Timeout will be raised if
                            the connection timesout.
                            Defaults to None, this means the connection will
                            hang until closed.

e.g.
    url = 'www.example.org/path/to/civi/codebase/civicrm/extern/rest.php'
    site_key ='your site key'
    api_key ='your api key'
    civicrm = CiviCRM(url, site_key, api_key, timeout=5)

    Connections will timeout after 5 seconds, and raise an error.

.. _things-to-note:

Things to note
--------------

* Of the options defined in the CiviCRM API
http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Using+ the+API#UsingtheAPI-
Parameters only limit, offset (& sequential) are currently supported,
sequential is set to 1 (true) by default and should not generally be changed.

* Entity and Action must always be specified explicitly. They are removed if
found in params, along with references to site/api keys.

* The CiviCRM API typically returns JSON (that would decode to a dictionary)
with the actual results you want stored in values(or result if a single  value
is expected). Additional info is typically API version and count. If  results
are returned successfully we only return the results themselves --  typically a
list of dictionaries, as this API version is always 3 with this  module, and
count can easily be derived using len().

* Returned values are generally sequential (i.e. a list (of dictionaries)
rather than a dictionary (of dictionaries) with numbers for keys) except
in the case of getfields & getoptions that return a dictionary with real keys.

* Results are unicode

* Most actions returns the (updated) record in question, others a count e.g.
* delete

* The is_valid_method uses getoptions() to both checks an option is valid and
returns the corresponding id (where this is valid). It does this for both an id
supplied as an int and a label supplied as a string. This is convinient as it
allows methods to take a descriptive label as well as a numeric id, rather than
being limited to this. When methods do this they don't use this method if a
numeric id is supplied, so that id is not checked for validity (though a
Civicrm Error will still be raised if its not) as it is assumed you know
what you are doing in this case, and we can save an extra API call for speed.

* The  replace API call is undocumented, AFAIK, so not implemented, use
getaction if you must.

        use  the create method  if you insist on using it).
        sourceid is an int, typically the contact_id for
        the person creating the activity, loosely defined.
        There is also a target_contact_id for person contacted etc.
        Subject is a string, typically a summary of the activity.
        date_time should be string not a datetime object.
        It's short hand for 'activity_date_time'.
